# A spreadsheet playground

Spreadsheets are an outstanding tool for building small software. However, mainstream spreadsheet software lacks the tools to create spreadsheets that are maintainable, error-free and easy to work with – spreadsheets that are "production-ready".

Bean is an exploration into new/overlooked ideas in the spreadsheet paradigm to solve this problem. It's intended to be a playground for trying out features (and _maybe_ eventually become a full-fledged spreadsheet software).

This involves looking at spreadsheets as a programming environment from the ground up. Read [this blogpost](https://blog.nilenso.com/blog/2023/11/10/spreadsheets-and-small-software) for the full background. [This talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yKf8TrLUOw) is a great introduction to the problem.

[Play around with it](https://bean.nilenso.com) (it's super early).
